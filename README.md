General Information

    • The application is designed to help find and organize important household documents-contracts, invoices, applications. Sometimes I have a problem with this, forgetting the date of important insurance.
    
    • Now I don't have to search through piles of papers, I can click and get to the most important document data.
    
    • The project is a challenge in my learning of C# language , .NET technology and learning about SQL databases (here I used SQLite)


    • Working on it gave me a lot of satisfaction but also showed me how much I still have to learn.
